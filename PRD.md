## 12. User Experience

NovaTab uses a carefully selected color palette to ensure clarity, accessibility, and a modern look. Each color is assigned a semantic role, with darker variants for active/pressed states and clear guidance for text usage.

| **Role**         | **Color**  | **Dark Variant** |
|------------------|------------|------------------|
| Primary          | #219ebc    | #1b7fa6          |
| Secondary        | #8ecae6    | #719fb0          |
| Accent           | #ffb703    | #cc9603          |
| Success          | #5ac4e0    | #468bb8          |
| Info             | #b4e0f0    | #8eb1c0          |
| Warning          | #ffd966    | #ccb24f          |
| Danger           | #fb8500    | #c96b00          |
| Link             | #405367    | #324352          |
| Text Primary     | #023047    | #021f38          |
| Text Secondary   | #ffb73f    | #cc8f2f          |

### Font / Text Roles

- **Body/Heading Text:** Use `#023047` for maximum contrast and readability.
- **Secondary Text/Captions/Disabled:** Use `#405367` for secondary copy.

### Why this setup works

- **Clear hierarchy:** Primary, secondary, and accent colors are visually distinct.
- **Semantic meaning:** Success, info, warning, and danger colors map to familiar UI conventions.
- **State feedback:** Darker variants are ready for button "hover" or "pressed" states.
- **Text contrast:** Navy (`#023047`) ensures readability; slate (`#405367`) works well for secondary text.

*This palette ensures NovaTab is visually appealing, accessible, and easy to use across all supported platforms.*
